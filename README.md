# SADI_A2
Basic Blackjack game with GUI built in Java.

Can add/remove players and specify starting points or elect default points. Each player can place a bet (custom or default) and be dealt individually. Auto selects next player after previous player dealt and prevents multiple bets/deals per player per game. Once all players have been dealt, house is dealt automatically and scores are updated.

Player info written to file on close, re-loaded on opening.
